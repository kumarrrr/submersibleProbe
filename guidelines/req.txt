Coding Test
You are part of a team that explores the bottom of the sea using a remotely
controlled submersible probe. Develop a REST API that allows control of the probe
from the surface using a set of interpreted controls.


Requirements

 You have a defined grid representing the ocean floor where location can be
identified using x/y co-ordinates
 You are given an initial starting point (x, y) for the probe and the direction it is
facing
 The probe will receive a collection of commands
 It should be able to:
o Move forwards and backwards
o Turn left and right
o Stay on the grid
o Avoid obstacles in the grid
o Print a summary of the co-ordinates visited

Things we are looking for:

It is highly desired that the code has been test driven
 Clean code
 Edge case consideration
 Object orientation
 Git history
Things we value:
 Simple, elegant code that reads like a narrative
 Thinking about the code more than writing it
 Tests that read like they were written as documentation of the code in the first
place
Complete the Unit testing
Write the test cases successfully
Please write the code in TDD (Test Driven Development) approach – First you need
to write test cases, then you need to implement the code that should be incremental
commits to see GIT history.
Once all the above completed, kindly share the github link with us for review.
